# Sololearn-Restaurant-Chain-Error
# Introduction
A popular restaurant chain has tracked the errors made when preparing orders before and after introducing an automated ordering system.
# Methodology
The secondary data used is obtained from Sololearn. The dataset was collected and organized chronologically by month over one full year. Each month's data represents the total count of errors occurring within that given period. The data-gathering process seems consistent, allowing comprehensive comparative analysis across all months.
